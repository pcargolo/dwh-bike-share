## Open the file named Data modeling and ETL in KNIME and Postgre.pptx
In this project I designed a dimensional data model based on data in several CSV files containing data from a fictional Bike Share company in Chicago
I created a data warehouse in Postgres (staging and core layers) and used KNIME Analytics Platform for data cleaning and manipulation and for loading my dimensional and fact tables into Postgres (ETL/Data Pipeline);

For data exploration I used MySQL to explore data and generated insights that would answer the business task, using joins, aggregate functions, temporary tables, CASE statements, subqueries, windows functions. 
For data visualization, creating a dashboard with bar charts, pie charts, heat maps and calculated fields.

My inspiration for this project was the dataset I got from my final project for the "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate" in Coursera and the knowledge I gained after the course "Datawarehouse - The Ultimate Guide" by Nikolai Schuler.
